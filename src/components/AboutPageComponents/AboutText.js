            Hi. My name is John De Costa. I have developed this site to
            demonstrate my skills with the following technologies.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span className="subheader">
              Gatsby Static Site Generator:{' '}
            </span> Website built with Gatsby at blazing fast, highly secure, infinitely scalable and cheap to host. Gatsby provides a modern framework for turning content into feature-rich, visually engaging apps and websites. The website is built with React and GraphQL.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span className="subheader">Visual Studio Code: </span> is a source code editor developed by Microsoft for Windows, Linux and macOS. It includes support for debugging, embedded Git control, syntax highlighting, intelligent code completion, snippets, and code refactoring. It is also customizable, so users can change the editor's theme, keyboard shortcuts, and preferences. It is free and open-source.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span className="subheader">
              Terminal / Command Line Interface{' '}
					</span>is a means of interacting with a computer program where the user (or client) issues commands to the program in the form of successive lines of text (command lines). Software developers, system administrators and advanced users still rely heavily on command-line interfaces to perform tasks more efficiently, configure their machine, or access programs and program features that are not available through a graphical interface. 
          </p>
          <p>
					<span className="subheader">Node.js </span>is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript run-time environment that executes JavaScript code outside of a browser. JavaScript is used primarily for client-side scripting, in which scripts written in JavaScript are embedded in a webpage's HTML and run client-side by a JavaScript engine in the user's web browser.

					 Node.js lets developers use JavaScript to write command line tools and for server-side scripting—running scripts server-side to produce dynamic web page content before the page is sent to the user's web browser. Consequently, Node.js represents a "JavaScript everywhere" paradigm, unifying web application development around a single programming language, rather than different languages for server side and client side scripts. 
          </p>
          <p>
					<span className="subheader">npm </span> (short for Node.js package manager) is a package manager for the JavaScript programming language. It is the default package manager for the JavaScript runtime environment Node.js. It consists of a command line client, also called npm, and an online database of public and paid-for private packages, called the npm registry.
          </p>
          <p>
					<span className="subheader">Git </span>is a distributed version control system for tracking changes in source code during software development. It is designed for coordinating work among programmers, but it can be used to track changes in any set of files. Its goals include speed data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows.
					</p>
          <p>
					<span className="subheader">GitHub </span>is a web-based hosting service for version control using Git. It is mostly used for computer code. It offers all of the distributed version control and source code management (SCM) functionality of Git as well as adding its own features. 
It provides access control and several collaboration features such as bug tracking, feature requests, task management, and wikis for every project. 
          </p>
					<p>
            <span className="subheader">Netlify </span>is a San Francisco-based cloud computing company that offers hosting and serverless backend services for static websites.

It features continuous deployment from Git across a global application delivery network,serverless form handling, support for AWS Lambda functions, and full integration with Let's Encrypt. It provides both free and paid plans. 
          </p>
					<p>
            <span className="subheader">Contentful </span>Contentful is how modern companies work with content. It’s content infrastructure for creating and managing content, backed by the tools for delivering it anywhere. With Contentful, developers and editors can work simultaneously and ship digital products faster.
          </p>
					<p>
            <span className="subheader">graphQL </span>is an open-source data query and manipulation language for APIs, and a runtime for fulfilling queries with existing data. 
						It provides an efficient, powerful and flexible approach to developing web APIs, and has been compared and contrasted with REST and other web service architectures. It allows clients to define the structure of the data required, and exactly the same structure of the data is returned from the server, therefore preventing excessively large amounts of data from being returned, but this has implications for how effective web caching of query results can be. The flexibility and richness of the query language also adds complexity that may not be worthwhile for simple APIs.
          </p>
					<p>
            <span className="subheader">HTML & CSS </span>Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for creating web pages and web applications. With Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and JavaScript, it forms a triad of cornerstone technologies for the World Wide Web.
          </p>
					<p>
            <span className="subheader">Javascript & JSX</span>often abbreviated as JS, is a high-level, interpreted programming language. JavaScript enables interactive web pages and thus is an essential part of web applications. The vast majority of websites use it, and all major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute it. 
						</p> 
						<p>
						JSX (JavaScript XML) is an extension to the JavaScript language syntax. Similar in appearance to HTML, JSX provides a way to structure component rendering using syntax familiar to many developers. React components are typically written using JSX, although they do not have to be (components may also be written in pure JavaScript).  
          </p>
					<p>
            <span className="subheader">React </span>(also known as React.js or ReactJS) is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React can be used as a base in the development of single-page or mobile applications. Complex React applications usually require the use of additional libraries for state management, routing, and interaction with an API
          </p>
					<p>
            <span className="subheader">Firefox & Chrome Developer Tools </span> allow developers to inspect the browser's rendered Document Object Model (DOM) to assist in the development, testing and debugging of code.
          </p>
					<p>
            <span className="subheader">JAM Stack </span>JAMstack: noun \’jam-stak’\
Modern web development architecture based on client-side JavaScript, reusable APIs, and prebuilt Markup.When we talk about “The Stack,” we no longer talk about operating systems, specific web servers, backend programming languages, or databases. 

The JAMstack is not about specific technologies. It’s a new way of building websites and apps that delivers better performance, higher security, lower cost of scaling, and a better developer experience.
